Prudence,\\nindeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and\\ntransient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to\\nsuffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they\\nare accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same\\nObject evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,\\nto throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.— \\x14Such has\\nbeen the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains\\nthem to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great\\nBritain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the\\nestablishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a\\ncandid world. \\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the\\npublic good.\\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing\\nimportance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained;\\nand when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of\\npeople, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the\\nLegislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. \\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant\\nfrom the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into\\ncompliance with his measures.\"),\n",

Like most important innovations and social changes, the printing press was an evolution that had deep roots in history.\\nMove forward in time to 1971, when Michael Hart invented the eBook. Like Gutenberg’s printing press, Hart’s innovation followed decades of prior work. To name a few, this includes Vannevar Bush’s “Memex” (1930s, based on microfiche), Bob Brown’s “The Readies” (1930s), Brown University’s “FRESS” (1960s), Ted Nelson’s Xanadu (1960s), and many others.\\nWhat Michael envisioned in 1971 was eBooks for reading enjoyment. This was the innovation. His focus was not on the mechanics of presentation or analysis, nor was it on outcomes like literary analysis or hermeneutics. The eBook as Michael envisioned it would have a similar purpose to the printed book: enjoyable to read, and a source of enlightenment, education, and entertainment. It would all be free, for unlimited reuse and without limitation of purpose.\\nFor the two decades from 1971-1991, Hart evangelized the idea of eBooks, and worked on the first 100 or so titles. These included historical documents - famously starting with the US Declaration of Independence. Also reference works, literary works, a few donated contemporary works, mathematical constants, and more. Subsequent years saw issuance of short videos and longer movies, graphical collections, sheet music, audio files, and eBooks in dozens of languages and formats.\\nLike the movable type printing press, the modern digital computer was a machine usable for many different purposes: all types of content, suitable for a wide range of interests. This inspired the vision and genius of Michael Hart.\\nProject Gutenberg evolved from a concept to become an organization. Volunteers would identity printed books to digitize, and create an eBook for Project Gutenberg to publish and redistribute.\\nBy the turn of the new millennium, Project Gutenberg was producing thousands of new eBooks per year. Distributed Proofreaders was launched, and became the biggest single source of new eBooks - harnessing the combined energies of volunteers.\\nDigital eBook readers became commonplace, and by the second decade of the millennium it was clear that eBooks had become widely adopted. Over the course of more than 30 years, the concept of literature being available for unlimited redistribution, freely available to all for any purpose, had gone from being seen as rather outlandish to becoming completely mainstream. This is the pathway of successful innovations, and in the case of Project Gutenberg the innovation has boundless social benefits.\\nProject Gutenberg has kept up with the times, offering e-reader friendly formats and features to help get free literature to as many people as possible - whether they are using a computer, a tablet, an e-reader, a mobile phone, or even if they are printing the eBooks on paper.\\nEveryone should have free, unlimited access to the world’s literature. Whenever they want, with a variety of formatting and delivery choices. “Literature,” said Hart, “should be as free as the air we breathe.”\\nOn the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Michael Hart’s invention, Project Gutenberg remains vibrant and relevant. The efforts of thousands of volunteers have created a library of literature, reference and more, with over 60 languages and dialects.\\nProject Gutenberg celebrates 50 years of eBooks, and of continuously improving methods for creating and distributing them. The enduring gift of literary works to the people of the world is the outcome of the spirit of innovation and devotion to the common good.\\nEnjoy these eBooks. Share them. Celebrate.\\nAnyone can Help Make New eBooks!\\nProject Gutenberg was built by volunteers, and all new eBooks are the result of volunteer effort. The best way to help is to join Distributed Proofreaders. DP includes supportive forums for discussion, an online tutorial, and a variety of roles to suit different skills and interests.

More generally, circulators can be used to realize\\nchiral networks [11] in systems where directional matter-\\nlight coupling is not easily accessible. In circuit quantum\\nelectrodynamics circulators are used for single port cou-\\npling or as isolators to protect the vulnerable cavity and\\nqubit states from electromagnetic noise. State of the art\\npassive microwave circulators are based on magneto-optic\\neﬀects which require sizable magnetic ﬁelds incompati-\\nble with ultra-low loss superconducting circuits forming\\na major roadblock towards a fully integrated quantum\\nprocessor based on superconducting qubits.\\nMany recent theoretical and experimental eﬀorts have\\nbeen devoted to overcome these limitations both in the\\noptical [12–14] and microwave regimes [2–5, 15–18]. In\\nparallel, the rapidly growing ﬁeld of optomechanical and\\nelectromechanical systems has shown promising potential\\nfor applications in quantum information processing and\\ncommunication, in particular for microwave to optical\\n∗shabir.barzanjeh@ist.ac.at\\n† jﬁnk@ist.ac.at\\nconversion [19, 20] and ampliﬁcation [21]. Very recently,\\nseveral theoretical proposals [6, 22, 23] have pointed out\\nthat optomechanical systems can lead to nonreciprocity\\nand ﬁrst isolators have just been demonstrated in the\\noptical domain [24–26]. Here, we present an on-chip mi-\\ncrowave circulator using a new and tunable silicon elec-\\ntromechanical system.\\nThe main elements of the microchip circulator device\\nare shown in Fig. 1 a-b.\\nThe circuit is comprised of\\nthree high-impedance spiral inductors (Li) capacitively\\ncoupled to the in-plane vibrational modes of a dielectric\\nnanostring mechanical resonator. The nanostring oscilla-\\ntor consists of two thin silicon beams that are connected\\nby two symmetric tethers and fabricated from a high re-\\nsistivity silicon-on-insulator device layer [27]. Four alu-\\nminum electrodes are aligned and evaporated on top of\\nthe two nanostrings, forming one half of the vacuum gap\\ncapacitors that are coupled to three microwave resonators\\nand one DC voltage bias line as shown schematically in\\nFig. 1c (see App. A for details).\\nThe voltage bias line can be used to generate an attrac-\\ntive force which pulls the nanobeam and tunes the oper-\\nating point frequencies of the device [9]. Fig. 1 d shows\\nthe measured resonance frequency change as a function\\nof the applied bias voltage Vdc. As expected, resonators\\n1 and 3 are tuned to higher frequency due to an increased\\nvacuum gap while resonator 2 is tuned to lower frequency.\\nA large tunable bandwidth of up to 30 MHz as obtained\\nfor resonator 2, the ability to excite the motion directly\\nand to modulate the electromechanical coupling in-situ\\nrepresents an important step towards new optomechani-\\ncal experiments and more practicable on-chip reciprocal\\nand nonreciprocal devices.\\nAs a ﬁrst step we carefully calibrate and character-\\nize the individual electromechanical couplings and noise\\nproperties. We then measure the bidirectional frequency\\nconversion between two microwave resonator modes as\\nmediated by one mechanical mode [10]. The incoming\\nsignal photons can also be distributed to two ports with\\nvarying probability as a function of the parametric drive\\nstrength and in direct analogy to a tunable beam split-\\nter.\\nWe present the experimental results, the relevant\\nsample parameters and the theoretical analysis of this\\nbidirectional frequency conversion process in App. B.\\nDirectionality is achieved by engaging the second me-\\nchanical mode, a method which was developed in paral-\\nlel to this work [28, 29] for demonstrating nonreciproc-\\narXiv:1706.00376v2  [quant-ph]  6 Jun 2017\\n2\\nResonator 1\\nNanostring\\nPort 1\\nPort 2\\nVdc (V)\\n- 4\\n- 2\\n0\\n 2\\n4\\n11.38\\n11.37\\n9.58\\n9.59\\n9.60\\n9.77\\n9.78\\n9.79\\n9.80\\nFrequency (GHz)\\nCs,1\\nCm,1\\nCm,3\\nCm,2\\nCm\\nL1\\nCs,3\\nL3\\nCs,2\\nL2\\na1,in\\na2,out\\nport 1\\na3,in\\na3,out\\nport 2\\na2,in\\na2,out\\nVdc\\nmode 2\\nmode 1\\na\\nd\\nc\\nb\\nVdc\\n10 ¹m\\n100 ¹m\\nResonator 3\\nResonator 2\\nResonator 1\\nResonator 2\\nResonator 3\\nFIG. 1.\\nMicrochip circulator and tunability. a, Scan-\\nning electron micrograph of the electromechanical device in-\\ncluding three microwave resonators, two physical ports, one\\nvoltage bias input (Vdc) and an inset of the spiral inductor\\ncross-overs (green dashed boxed area). b, Enlarged view of\\nthe silicon nanostring mechanical oscillator with four vacuum-\\ngap capacitors coupled to the three inductors and one voltage\\nbias.

Here, ∆11 = ∆21 = ωm,1 + δ1\\nand ∆22 = ∆12 = ωm,2 + δ2 are the detunings of the\\ndrive tones with respect to the cavities and Hoﬀde-\\nscribes the time dependent coupling of the mechanical\\nmodes to the cavity ﬁelds due to the oﬀ-resonant drive\\ntones.\\nThese additional coupling terms create cross-\\ndamping [30] and renormalize the mechanical modes, and\\ncan only be neglected in the weak coupling regime for\\nGij, κj ≪ωj, |ωm,2 −ωm,1|.\\nTo see how the nonreciprocity arises we use the quan-\\ntum Langevin equations of motion along with the input-\\noutput theorem to express the scattering matrix Sij of\\nthe system described by the Hamiltonian (1), and relat-\\ning the input photons ain,i(ωi) at port i to the output\\nphotons aout,j(ωj) at port j via aout,i = P\\nj=1,2 Sijain,i\\nwith i = 1, 2.\\nThe dynamics of the four-mode sys-\\ntem described by Hamiltonian (1) is fully captured by\\na set of linear equations of motion as veriﬁed in App. C.\\nSolving these equations in the frequency domain, us-\\ning the input-output relations, and setting φ22 = φ,\\nφ11 = φ21 = φ12 = 0, the ratio of backward to forward\\ntransmission reads\\nλ := S12(ω)\\nS21(ω) =\\n√C11C21Σm,2(ω) + √C12C22Σm,1(ω)eiφ\\n√C11C21Σm,2(ω) + √C12C22Σm,1(ω)e−iφ .\\n(2)\\nHere, Σm,j = 1 + 2i\\n\\x02\\n(−1)jδ −ω\\n\\x03\\n/γm,j is the inverse of\\nthe mechanical susceptibility divided by the mechanical\\nlinewidth γm,j and Cij = 4G2\\nij/(κiγm,j) is the optome-\\nchanical cooperativity. Note that, in Eq. (2) we assume\\nthe device satisﬁes the impedance matching condition on\\nresonance i.e. Sii(ω = 0) = 0 which can be achieved in\\nthe high cooperativity limit (Cij ≫1).\\nInspection of equation (2) reveals the crucial role of\\nthe relative phase between the drive tones φ and the de-\\ntuning δ to obtain nonreciprocal transmission. When the\\ncooperativities for all four optomechanical couplings are\\nequal (Cij = C) then perfect isolation, i.e. λ = 0, occurs\\nfor\\ntan[φ(ω)] = δ(γm,1 + γm,2) + ω(γm,2 −γm,1)\\nγm,1γm,2/2 −2(δ2 −ω2)\\n.\\n(3)\\nEquation 3 shows that on resonance (ω = 0) tan[φ] ∝δ,\\nhighlighting the importance of the detuning δ to obtain\\nnonreciprocity. Tuning all four drives to the exact red\\nsideband frequencies (δ = 0) results in bidirectional be-\\nhavior\\n(λ = 1).\\nAt the optimum phase φ given by\\nEq.

Optomechanical isolator. a, Mode coupling dia-\\ngram for optomechanically induced nonreciprocity. Two mi-\\ncrowave cavities (C1 and C2) are coupled to two mechanical\\nmodes (M1 and M2) with the optomechanical coupling rates\\nGij (where i, j = 1, 2), inducing two distinct signal conversion\\npaths. Power spectral density (PSD) of the two microwave\\ncavities and arrows indicating the frequency of the four mi-\\ncrowave pump tones slightly detuned by δi from the lower\\nmotional sidebands of the resonances.\\nAll four pumps are\\nphase-locked while the signal tone is applied.\\nOnly one of\\nthe microwave source phases is varied to ﬁnd the optimal in-\\nterference condition for directional transmission between port\\n1 and 2. b, Measured power transmission (dots) in forward\\n|S21|2 (cavity 1 →cavity 2) and backward directions |S12|2\\n(cavity 2 →cavity 1) as a function of probe detuning for two\\ndiﬀerent phases φ = ±102.6 degrees. The solid lines show the\\nresults of the coupled-mode theory model discussed in the\\ntext. c, Experimental data (top) and theoretical model (bot-\\ntom) of measured transmission coeﬃcients |S12|2 and |S21|2 as\\na function of signal detuning and pump phase φ. Dashed-lines\\nindicate the line plot locations of panel b.\\nwhere η1(2) = κext,1(2)/κ1(2) is the resonator coupling ra-\\ntio and κi = κint,i + κext,i is the total damping rate.\\nHere κint,i denotes the internal loss rate and κext,i the\\nloss rate due to the cavity to waveguide coupling. Equa-\\ntion (4) shows that the maximum of the transmission in\\nforward direction, |S21|2 = η1η2[1−(2C)−1], occurs when\\n2C = 1 + 4δ2/γ2 and for large cooperativities C ≫1.\\nThese conditions, as implemented in our experiment, en-\\nable the observation of asymmetric frequency conversion\\nwith strong isolation in the backward direction and small\\ninsertion loss in forward direction.\\nUsing the on-chip electromechanical microwave circuit\\nshown in Fig. 1 a, we experimentally realize directional\\nwavelength conversion between two superconducting coil\\nresonators at (ω1, ω2)/2π = (9.55, 9.82) GHz coupled to\\ntwo diﬀerent physical waveguide ports and measurement\\nlines with (η1, η2) = (0.74, 0.86). Here, we use the two\\nlowest-frequency vibrational in-plane modes of the me-\\nchanical resonator at (ωm,1, ωm,2)/2π = (4.34, 5.64) MHz\\nwith intrinsic damping rates (γm,1, γm,2)/2π = (4, 8) Hz.\\nThe vacuum optomechanical coupling strengths for these\\nmode combinations are (g0,11, g0,12, g0,21, g0,22)/2π\\n=\\n(33, 34, 13, 31) Hz.\\nFigure 2 b shows the measured transmission of the\\nwavelength conversion in the forward |S21|2 and back-\\nward directions |S12|2 as a function of probe detuning\\nfor two diﬀerent phases as set by one out of the four\\nphase locked microwave drives. At φ = −102.6 degree\\nand over a frequency range of 1.5 kHz we measure high\\ntransmission from cavity 1 to 2 with an insertion loss of\\n2.4 dB while in the backward direction the transmission\\nis suppressed by up to 40.4 dB. Likewise, at the positive\\nphase of φ = 102.6 degree the transmission from cavity 1\\nto 2 is suppressed while the transmission from cavity 2 to\\n1 is high. In both cases we observe excellent agreement\\nwith theory (solid lines). Fig. 2 c shows the S parameters\\nfor the whole range of phases φ, which are symmetric and\\nbidirectional around φ = 0. We ﬁnd excellent agreement\\nwith theory over the full range of measured phases with\\nless than 10% deviation to independently calibrated drive\\nphoton numbers and without any other free parameters.\\nFor bidirectional wavelength conversion, higher coop-\\nerativity enhances the bandwidth. In contrast, the band-\\nwidth of the nonreciprocal conversion is independent of\\ncooperativity and set only by the intrinsic mechanical\\nlinewidths γm,i, which can be seen in Eq (2). This high-\\nlights the fact that the isolation appears when the en-\\ntire signal energy is dissipated in the mechanical environ-\\nment, a lossy bath that can be engineered eﬀectively [7].\\nIn the present case it is the oﬀ-resonant coupling be-\\ntween the resonators and the mechanical oscillator which\\nmodiﬁes this bath. The applied drives create an eﬀec-\\ntive interaction between the mechanical modes, where\\none mode acts as a reservoir for the other and vice versa.\\nThis changes both the damping rates and the eigenfre-\\nquencies of the mechanical modes. It therefore increases\\nthe instantaneous bandwidth of the conversion and auto-\\nmatically introduces the needed detuning, which is fully\\ntaken into account in the theory.\\nThe described two-port isolator can be extended to an\\neﬀective three-port device by parametrically coupling the\\nthird microwave resonator capacitively to the dielectric\\nnanostring, as shown in Fig. 1 a. The third resonator at\\na resonance frequency of ω3/2π = 11.30 GHz is coupled\\nto the waveguide with η3 = 0.52 and to the two in-plane\\nmechanical modes with (g0,31, g0,32)/2π = (22, 45) Hz.\\nSimilar to the isolator, we establish a parametric cou-\\n4\\n1.9 dB cavity loss\\n3.4 dB cavity loss\\n4.1 dB cavity loss\\n3.8 dB insertion loss\\n3.8 dB insertion loss\\n4.4 dB insertion loss\\n3\\n3\\na\\nb\\nc\\nTransmission (dB)\\n-40\\n-30\\n-20\\n-10\\n0\\nPump phase (deg)\\n-180\\n-90\\n0\\n90\\n180\\n-180\\n-90\\n0\\n90\\n180\\nProbe detuning (Hz)\\n-700 -350\\n350 700\\n0\\n-700 -350\\n350 700\\n0\\n-700 -350\\n350 700\\n0\\nData\\nData\\nData\\nTheory\\nTheory\\nTheory\\njS12j2\\njS23j2\\njS31j2\\njS12j2\\njS23j2\\njS31j2\\nPhase = -54\\nPhase = -54\\nPhase = -54\\nC3\\nC2\\nC1\\nC3\\nC2\\nC1\\nC3\\nC2\\nC1\\njS12j2\\njS23j2\\njS32j2\\njS13j2\\njS31j2\\njS21j2\\nC1\\nM2\\nM1\\nC2\\nG11\\nG21\\nG22\\nG12\\nG31\\nG32\\na1,in\\na1,out\\na3,in\\na3,out\\nC2\\na2,in\\na2,out\\n0\\n-20\\n-40\\ndB\\nFIG. 3.

Using\\nan extra microwave source as probe signal, we measure\\nthe power transmission between all ports and directions\\nas shown in Fig. 3 b for a single ﬁxed phase of φ = −54\\ndegree, optimized experimentally for forward circulation.\\nAt this phase we see high transmission in the for-\\nward direction S21,32,13 with an insertion loss of (3.8,\\n3.8, 4.4) dB and an isolation in the backward direction\\nS12,23,31 of up to (18.5, 23, 23) dB. The full dependence of\\nthe circulator scattering parameters on the drive phase\\nis shown in Fig. 3 c where we see excellent agreement\\nwith theory. The added noise photon number of the de-\\nvice is found to be (nadd,21, nadd,32, nadd,13) = (4, 6.5, 3.6)\\nin the forward direction and (nadd,12, nadd,23, nadd,31) =\\n(4, 4, 5.5) in the backward direction, limited by the ther-\\nmal occupation of the mechanical modes and discussed\\nin more detail in App. D.\\nIn conclusion, we realized a frequency tunable mi-\\ncrowave isolator / circulator that is highly directional and\\noperates with low loss and added noise.

As predicted by Eq. (B2),\\nthe transmission between the two cavities is maximum for C1 = C2 ≈95.

In fact this term allows both optomechanical cooling (with rate Γi = 4G2\\ni /κi) and\\nbidirectional photon conversion between two distinct microwave frequencies. In the photon conversion process, ﬁrst\\nan input microwave signal at frequency ω1 with amplitude ain,1(ω1) is down-converted into the mechanical mode at\\nfrequency ωm, i.e. a1(ω1)\\nH∝a1b†\\n−−−−−→b(ωm).

In fact, the Hermitian aspect of the Hamiltonian (B1) makes the conversion process bidirectional and holds\\nthe time-reversal symmetry.\\nThe photon conversion eﬃciency, which is deﬁned as the ratio of the output-signal photon ﬂux over the input-signal\\nphoton ﬂux, is given by |S21|2 =\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\naout,2(ω2)\\nain,1(ω1)\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\n2\\n. Since the conversion process is bidirectional therefore |S21| = |S12| = |T|.\\nIn the steady state and in the weak coupling regime the conversion eﬃciency reduces to\\n|T|2 =\\n4η1η2C1C2\\n(1 + C1 + C2)2 ,\\n(B2)\\n9\\nwhere C1(2) =\\n4g2\\n0,1(2)n1(2)\\nκ1(2)γm\\nis the electromechanical cooperativity for cavity 1 (2) and η1(2) =\\nκext,1(2)\\nκ1(2)\\nis the output\\ncoupling ratio in which κi = κint,i + κext,i is the total damping rate while κint,i and κext,i show the intrinsic and\\nextrinsic decay rate of the microwave cavities, respectively.

The former condition balances the photon-phonon conversion rate for each cavity\\nwhile the later condition guarantees the mechanical damping rate γm is much weaker than the damping rates Γi =\\nγmCi. Under these two conditions, the ideal photon conversion is achieved i.e. |T|2 = 1 (perfect transmission) and\\n|S11|2 = |S22|2 = 0 (no reﬂection). The denominator of Eq. (B2) indicates that the bandwidth of the conversion is\\ngiven by ΓT = γm + Γ1 + Γ2, which is the total back-action-damped linewidth of the mechanical resonator in the\\npresence of the two microwave drive ﬁelds.\\nWe perform coherent microwave frequency conversion using the intermediate nanostring resonator as a coupling\\nelement between two superconducting coil resonators at ω1/2π = 9.55 GHz and ω2/2π = 9.82 GHz as shown in\\nFig 1 a. The microwave cavities are accessible by ports”, i.e. semi-inﬁnite transmission lines giving the modes ﬁnite\\nenergy decay rates leading to the cavity linewidths κ1/2π = 2.42 MHz and κ2/2π = 1.98 MHz with associated\\noutput coupling ratios η1 = 0.74 and η2 = 0.86, indicating that both cavities are strongly overcoupled to the two\\ndistinct physical ports 1 and 2. The fundamental mode of the mechanical oscillator has a resonance frequency of\\nωm/2π = 4.34MHz with the corresponding damping rate of γm/2π = 4Hz. Measuring the mechanical resonator noise\\nspectrum along with the oﬀ-resonant reﬂection coeﬃcients of each cavity and measurement line, we calibrate the gain\\nand attenuation in each input-output line and accurately back out the vacuum optomechanical coupling rate for each\\ncavity of g01/2π = 33Hz and g02/2π = 13Hz.\\nFigure 4 c shows the measured scattering parameters |S11|2 (red line), |S22|2 (blue line), and |T|2 = |S12| · |S21|\\n(yellow line) versus the electromechanical cooperativity C2 at C1 = 95. As predicted by Eq. (B2) at C1 = C2 ≃95\\nwe measure a transmission of |T|2 = 0.64, which is dominated by internal losses of the cavities limiting the maximum\\nreachable conversion eﬃciency to |T|2 ≤η1η2 = 0.64.\\nAnother important aspect of such a transducer is the dynamic range of the device. In the inset of Fig. 4 c we\\nshow measured maximum transmission as a function of the applied signal power. Our results demonstrate that high\\nconversion eﬃciencies can be maintained up to about −80 dBm input signal power, corresponding to about 105 signal\\nphotons inside the cavities. At even higher signal powers the transmission eﬃciency is degraded abruptly, because\\nthe probe tone acts as an additional strong drive invalidating the transducer model, and also because of an increase\\nof the resonance frequency shifts and resonator losses.\\nAppendix C: General theory of a coupled electromechanical system\\n1.\\nHamiltonian of a multi-mode electromechanical transducer\\nIn this section we present a general theory to describe the nonreciprocal behavior of our on-chip electromechanical\\ntransducer, shown in Fig 1a of the main paper. We begin with an optomechanical system comprised of three microwave\\ncavities with frequencies ωi and linewidths κi where i = 1, 2, 3 that are coupled to two vibrational modes of a\\nmechanical oscillator with frequencies ωm.i and damping rates γm,i where i = 1, 2. To tune a desired coupling into\\nresonance, we assume the cavities are coherently driven with six microwave tones, with frequencies detuned from the\\nlower motional sidebands of the resonances by δ0,i. The Hamiltonian of the system is (¯h = 1)[34]\\nH =\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\nωia†\\niai +\\n2\\nX\\ni=1\\nωm,ib†\\nibi +\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\n2\\nX\\nj=1\\ng0,ija†\\niai(bj + b†\\nj) + Hd,\\n(C1)\\nwhere ai is the annihilation operator for the cavity i, bj is the annihilation operator of the mechanical mode j, and\\nHd =\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\n2\\nX\\nj=1\\nEij(aiei(ωd,ijt+φij) + a†\\nie−i(ωd,ijt+φij)),\\n(C2)\\n10\\ndescribes the Hamiltonian of the pumps with amplitude Eij = E∗\\nij, frequency ωd,ij, and phase φij.\\nWe can linearize Hamiltonian (C1) by expanding the cavity modes around their steady-state ﬁeld amplitudes,\\nai →ai −P2\\nj=1 αije−iωd,ijt, where |αij|2 = 4|Eije−iφij|2/(κ2\\ni + 4∆2\\nij) is the mean number of photons inside the cavity\\ni induced by the microwave pump due to driving mechanical mode j, the κi = κint,i + κext,i is the total damping rate\\nof the cavity while κint,i and κext,i show the intrinsic and extrinsic decay rate of the microwave cavities, respectively.\\nHere, ∆ij = ωi −ωd,ij is the detuning of the drive tone with respect to cavity i.

Inspection of Hamiltonians (C4)\\nand (C5) reveals that each drive tone generates two diﬀerent types of interactions: Resonant coupling in which the\\ndrive tone couples a single mechanical mode to a single cavity mode, described by the time-independent part of the\\nHamiltonian (C4). Each drive tone also generates an interaction which couples the other mechanical mode to the\\ncavity oﬀ-resonantly. The Hamiltonians (C5) explain this oﬀ-resonant coupling between cavity ﬁelds and mechanical\\nmodes. As we will see, these oﬀ-resonant couplings alter the mechanical damping rate, which changes the isolation\\nbandwidth and also cools the mechanical modes. In addition, the coupling also introduces mechanical frequency shifts\\nand introduces an eﬀective detuning for the drive tones. Note that, within the rotating wave approximation (RWA)\\nthe non-resonant/time-dependent components of the eﬀective linearized interactions can be neglected in the weak\\ncoupling regime and when the cavity decay rates κi are much smaller than the two mechanical frequencies ωm,i and\\ntheir diﬀerence\\n|Fij|, κi ≪ωm,j, |ωm,2 −ωm,1|.\\n(C7)\\nFinally, we note that for the isolator case we deal with two cavities coupled two mechanical modes, which mathemat-\\nically is equivalent to set G31 = G32 = F31 = F32 = 0 in our general model.

The auxiliary modes A±\\ni = aie±iδωmt, B1 = b1eiδωmt and B2 = b2e−iδωmt describe the oﬀ-resonant\\ncomponents of the equations of motion. Here, we take δωm to be much larger than the relevant system frequencies, i.e.\\nδωm ≫γm,i, δ0,i, ω, and can thus adiabatically eliminate the auxiliary modes by taking ˙Bj = ˙A±\\ni = 0 in Eqs.

(C13) we assume that the oﬀ-resonant interaction does not considerably modify the\\nself-interaction and damping rate of the cavity modes. Inspection of Eqs. (C13) reveals that the oﬀ-resonant coupling\\nbetween mechanical modes and cavities shifts the resonance frequency and damps/cools the mechanical modes by\\nintroducing a cross-damping between them. The strength of the frequency shift and the cross-damping is given by\\nthe oﬀ-resonant optomechanical coupling parameters Fij, which indicates that the drive tones creates an eﬀective\\ncoupling between the two mechanical modes. In the weak coupling regime and for very large δωm this cross-coupling\\nis negligible, thus δj ≈δ0,j and Γm,j ≈γm,j.\\nWe can solve the Eqs.

Typically data is collected in text corpora, using either rule-based, statistical or neural-based approaches in machine learning and deep learning.\\nMajor tasks in natural language processing are speech recognition, text classification, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nNatural language processing has its roots in the 1950s. Already in 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence, though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence. The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language.\\n\\n\\n=== Symbolic NLP (1950s – early 1990s) ===\\nThe premise of symbolic NLP is well-summarized by John Searle\\'s Chinese room experiment: Given a collection of rules (e.g., a Chinese phrasebook, with questions and matching answers), the computer emulates natural language understanding (or other NLP tasks) by applying those rules to the data it confronts.\\n\\n1950s: The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English. The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem.  However, real progress was much slower, and after the ALPAC report in 1966, which found that ten years of research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced. Little further research in machine translation was conducted in America (though some research continued elsewhere, such as Japan and Europe) until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed.\\n1960s: Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU, a natural language system working in restricted \"blocks worlds\" with restricted vocabularies, and ELIZA, a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist, written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966. Using almost no information about human thought or emotion, ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly human-like interaction. When the \"patient\" exceeded the very small knowledge base, ELIZA might provide a generic response, for example, responding to \"My head hurts\" with \"Why do you say your head hurts?\". Ross Quillian\\'s successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words, because that was all that would fit in a computer  memory at the time.\\n1970s: During the 1970s, many programmers began to write \"conceptual ontologies\", which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data.  Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981).  During this time, the first chatterbots were written (e.g., PARRY).\\n1980s: The 1980s and early 1990s mark the heyday of symbolic methods in NLP. Focus areas of the time included research on rule-based parsing (e.g., the development of HPSG as a computational operationalization of generative grammar), morphology (e.g., two-level morphology), semantics (e.g., Lesk algorithm), reference (e.g., within Centering Theory) and other areas of natural language understanding (e.g., in the Rhetorical Structure Theory). Other lines of research were continued, e.g., the development of chatterbots with Racter and Jabberwacky. An important development (that eventually led to the statistical turn in the 1990s) was the ris'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Natural language', 'summary': 'In neuropsychology, linguistics, and philosophy of language, a natural language or ordinary language is any language that occurs naturally in a human community by a process of use, repetition, and change.

It can take different forms, typically either a spoken language or a sign language. Natural languages are distinguished from constructed and formal languages such as those used to program computers or to study logic.\\n\\n\\n== Defining natural language ==\\nNatural language can be broadly defined as different from\\n\\nartificial and constructed languages, e.g. computer programming languages\\nconstructed international auxiliary languages\\nnon-human communication systems in nature such as whale and other marine mammal vocalizations or honey bees\\' waggle dance.\\nAll varieties of world languages are natural languages, including those that are associated with linguistic prescriptivism or language regulation. (Nonstandard dialects can be viewed as a wild type in comparison with standard languages.) An official language with a regulating academy such as Standard French, overseen by the Académie Française, is classified as a natural language (e.g. in the field of natural language processing), as its prescriptive aspects do not make it constructed enough to be a constructed language or controlled enough to be a controlled natural language.\\n\\n\\n== Controlled languages ==\\n\\nControlled natural languages are subsets of natural languages whose grammars and dictionaries have been restricted in order to reduce ambiguity and complexity. This may be accomplished by decreasing usage of superlative or adverbial forms, or irregular verbs. Typical purposes for developing and implementing a controlled natural language are to aid understanding by non-native speakers or to ease computer processing. An example of a widely-used controlled natural language is Simplified Technical English, which was originally developed for aerospace and avionics industry manuals.\\n\\n\\n== International constructed languages ==\\n\\nBeing constructed, International auxiliary languages such as Esperanto and Interlingua are not considered natural languages, with the possible exception of true native speakers of such languages. Natural languages evolve, through fluctuations in vocabulary and syntax, to incrementally improve human communication. In contrast, Esperanto was created by Polish ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof in the late 19th century.\\nSome natural languages have become organically \"standardized\" through the synthesis of two or more pre-existing natural languages over a relatively short period of time through the development of a pidgin, which is not considered a language, into a stable creole language. A creole such as Haitian Creole has its own grammar, vocabulary and literature. It is spoken by over 10 million people worldwide and is one of the two official languages of the Republic of Haiti.\\nAs of 1996, there were 350 attested families with one or more native speakers of Esperanto. Latino sine flexione, another international auxiliary language, is no longer widely spoken.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nLanguage acquisition – Process in which a first language is being acquired\\nOrigin of language – Relationship between language and human evolution\\nFormal semantics (natural language) – Study of meaning in natural languages\\nWhistled language – Emulation of speech by whistling\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==')]\n"
